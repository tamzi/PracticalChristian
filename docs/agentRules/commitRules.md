# Commit Message Rules

> **For AI Agents:** Git commit message guidelines for PracticalChristian

## 🛑 STOP AND VERIFY

**When user says "commit", you MUST do this FIRST:**

1. **Run `git status` - What actually needs committing?**
2. **For EACH file, run the checklist below**
3. **Fix violations BEFORE staging anything**
4. **Only after ALL checks pass, then commit**

### Quick Checklist (Do this for EVERY file):

**For Documentation Files (.md):**

- [ ] `wc -l <file>` - Module READMEs must be < 100 lines
- [ ] Check filename - Must use camelCase (except README.md and Agents.md)
- [ ] No multiple doc files in one commit
- [ ] Read the file - verify no duplications, hallucinations

**For Code Files:**

- [ ] Read the file - verify what changed
- [ ] Check it compiles mentally
- [ ] Check dependencies are correct

**ONLY commit after all checks pass.**

## 🚫 CRITICAL: NEVER Use `git push --no-verify`

**ABSOLUTE RULE: Using `git push --no-verify` is FORBIDDEN.**

**Why this rule exists:**

The pre-push hook exists to protect code quality and prevent broken code from reaching the
repository. Bypassing it:

- ❌ **Breaks the build** - Pushes code that fails tests or quality checks
- ❌ **Wastes team time** - Forces others to deal with your broken code
- ❌ **Violates commit rules** - Allows improperly structured commits into history
- ❌ **Defeats the purpose** - Makes the entire quality system meaningless
- ❌ **Creates technical debt** - Problems compound and become harder to fix

**What to do instead:**

If the pre-push hook blocks your push, there's a REASON:

1. ✅ **Read the error message** - It tells you exactly what's wrong
2. ✅ **Fix the violations** - Follow the guidance provided
3. ✅ **Use `git rebase -i`** - To split or fix commits if needed
4. ✅ **Run checks manually** - `./gradlew detekt test` to debug issues
5. ✅ **Ask for help** - If you're stuck, ask the team

**The ONLY exception:**

In true emergency situations (production down, critical hotfix needed immediately), you may use
`--no-verify` BUT:

1. You MUST immediately create a follow-up branch to fix the violations
2. You MUST notify the team about what was bypassed and why
3. You MUST ensure the follow-up fixes are merged within 24 hours

**For AI Agents specifically:**

- ❌ **NEVER suggest `git push --no-verify`** to the user
- ❌ **NEVER use `git push --no-verify`** in your commands
- ✅ **ALWAYS fix the root cause** of any pre-push failures
- ✅ **ALWAYS help the user** understand and resolve violations

**Remember:** If you're tempted to use `--no-verify`, it means something is wrong with your commits.
Fix the commits, don't bypass the safety checks.

##  🛑 Critical Rules for AI Agents

### ALWAYS Review Work Before Committing

**MANDATORY PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST:**

Before creating ANY commit, you MUST:

1. **✅ Read back all changes made**
    - Use `grep_search` or `read_file` to verify what you actually changed
    - Don't trust your memory - verify the actual file contents

2. **✅ Check for repetitions**
    - Look for duplicated code blocks
    - Check for repeated sections in documentation
    - Verify no copy-paste errors

3. **✅ Check for hallucinations**
    - Verify all file paths you reference actually exist
    - Confirm all function/class names match the codebase
    - Double-check version numbers and dates
    - Ensure all links point to real files

4. **✅ Verify consistency**
    - Check that naming follows project conventions (camelCase for docs)
    - Ensure coding style matches existing code
    - Verify imports and dependencies are correct

5. **✅ Test your changes mentally**
    - Would this code compile?
    - Are all referenced files in place?
    - Did you update all necessary references?

6. **✅ ALWAYS Verify documentation compliance** (when committing docs)
    - **REQUIRED:** Run `wc -l <file>` for module READMEs - MUST be < 100 lines
    - **REQUIRED:** Check filename uses camelCase (except README.md and Agents.md)
    - **REQUIRED:** If violations found, FIX THEM before committing
   - See [documentationRules.md](./documentationRules.md) for the full checklist AND MAKE APPROPRIATE CHANGES

**Example Review Process:**

```bash
# After making changes, BEFORE committing:

# 1. Review what you actually changed
git diff --staged

# 2. Read back the modified files
# Use read_file tool to verify contents

# 3. Search for any potential issues
# Use grep_search to find references that need updating

# 4. Only THEN commit
git commit -m "Added feature X"
```

**Why this matters:**

- Prevents broken code from being committed
- Avoids "fixing" commits that clutter history
- Ensures quality and correctness
- Saves time debugging later

### NEVER Push Commits

**AI agents must NEVER run `git push` or any push commands.**

- ✅ **Do:** Create commits with `git commit`
- ✅ **Do:** Stage files with `git add`
- ✅ **Do:** Show commit log with `git log`
- ❌ **NEVER:** Run `git push`
- ❌ **NEVER:** Push to remote repositories
- ❌ **NEVER:** Force push with `git push -f`

**Reason:** Pushing requires authentication and user approval. Always let the user push their own
commits.

**After committing:**

```bash
# ✅ Show what was committed
git log --oneline -5

# ✅ Tell user to push manually
# User will run: git push
```

### ⚠️ ONE Documentation File Per Commit

**CRITICAL RULE:** Each documentation file MUST have its own separate commit. NEVER bundle multiple
documentation files together.

**Before committing any documentation file:**

1. ✅ **Verify it follows [documentationRules.md](./documentationRules.md)**
   - Location, size, naming, content rules
   - See documentationRules.md for full checklist

2. ✅ **One file per commit**
   - Never bundle multiple docs together

**❌ WRONG - Multiple docs in one commit:**

```bash
git add docs/agentRules/commitRules.md docs/agentRules/README.md
git commit -m "Updated agent documentation"  # NEVER DO THIS!
```

**✅ CORRECT - One commit per doc file:**

```bash
# First commit
git add docs/agentRules/commitRules.md
git commit -m "Updated commit rules documentation"

# Second commit
git add docs/agentRules/README.md
git commit -m "Updated agents README"

# Third commit
git add docs/agentRules.md
git commit -m "Updated agents guide"
```

**Why this rule exists:**

- Makes changes easy to track per document
- Allows reverting specific document changes
- Keeps commit history clean and focused
- Each document has its own change history

**Remember:** If you modify 5 documentation files, you create 5 separate commits!

### ⚠️ Split Commits by Layer and Dependency

**CRITICAL RULE:** When implementing a feature, split commits by logical layers following dependency
order. Each layer should be its own commit.

**❌ WRONG - Everything in one commit:**

```bash
# One big commit with 8 files
git add strings.xml TopLevelDestination.kt ChangingRoomApp.kt ChangingRoomAppState.kt \
    MainActivity.kt HomeNavigation.kt StoriesNavigation.kt ProductNavigation.kt
git commit -m "Implemented app navigation with bottom bar"  # TOO BIG!
```

**✅ CORRECT - Split by logical layers:**

```bash
# Commit 1: Resources first (no dependencies)
git add app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
git commit -m "Added bottom navigation string resources"

# Commit 2: Data structures (depends on resources)
git add app/.../navigation/TopLevelDestination.kt
git commit -m "Created TopLevelDestination enum"

# Commit 3: Feature helpers (depends on data structures)
git add feature/home/navigation/HomeNavigation.kt \
    feature/stories/navigation/StoriesNavigation.kt \
    feature/productcatalog/navigation/ProductCatalogNavigation.kt
git commit -m "Added navigation helper functions to features"

# Commit 4: State management (depends on helpers)
git add app/.../ui/ChangingRoomAppState.kt
git commit -m "Created ChangingRoomAppState for navigation"

# Commit 5: UI components (depends on state)
git add app/.../ui/ChangingRoomApp.kt
git commit -m "Created ChangingRoomApp with bottom navigation"

# Commit 6: Integration (depends on UI)
git add app/.../ChangingRoomAppMainActivity.kt
git commit -m "Updated MainActivity to use ChangingRoomApp"
```

**Why this rule exists:**

- **Easier to review** - Each commit tells one clear story
- **Easier to revert** - Can undo specific parts without breaking everything
- **Follows dependency order** - Lower layers first, higher layers later
- **Better git bisect** - Easier to find which commit introduced an issue
- **Clearer intent** - Each commit has a single, obvious purpose

**Guideline: One commit should ideally change 1-3 files, maximum 5 files**

**Layers to separate (in order):**

1. **Resources** (strings, drawables, etc.) - No dependencies
2. **Data models/enums** - Depends on resources
3. **Utilities/helpers** - Depends on models
4. **State management** - Depends on helpers
5. **UI components** - Depends on state
6. **Integration/wiring** - Depends on UI

**Remember:** If a commit touches 8+ files, it's probably too big! Split it.

## Rules

### 1. Use Past Tense

- **Do:** Added, Fixed, Removed, Updated, Renamed, Implemented, Refactored
- **Don't:** Add, Fix, Remove, Adding, Fixing

### 2. Be Concise

- One line is enough
- Keep it under 50 characters
- If you need multiple paragraphs, the commit is too big

### 3. No Period at the End

- **Do:** `Added user authentication`
- **Don't:** `Added user authentication.`

### 4. One Documentation File Per Commit

- ✅ **Do:** One commit per documentation file
- ❌ **NEVER:** Bundle multiple documentation files in one commit

**Example:**

```bash
# ✅ Correct - Separate commits
git add docs/agentRules/commitRules.md
git commit -m "Updated commit rules documentation"

git add docs/agentRules/README.md
git commit -m "Updated agents README"

# ❌ Wrong - Multiple docs in one commit
git add docs/agentRules/commitRules.md docs/agentRules/README.md
git commit -m "Updated agent documentation"  # NO!
```

**Why:** This makes it easy to track changes to individual documents and revert specific changes.

### 5. Atomic Commits

- One logical change per commit
- If explaining needs paragraphs = commit too big
- Split large changes into smaller, focused commits
- **Rule of thumb:** 1-3 files per commit is ideal, 8+ files is too big
- Follow dependency order when splitting (see "Split Commits by Layer")

**When to split a commit:**

- Changes touch multiple architectural layers (resources, models, UI, integration)
- More than 5-8 files modified
- Multiple unrelated concerns mixed together
- Would be hard to review as one change

**Example of splitting:**

```bash
# ❌ Too big - 8 files in one commit
git commit -m "Implemented navigation"  # strings, models, state, UI, integration

# ✅ Just right - Split into 6 focused commits
git commit -m "Added bottom navigation string resources"     # 1 file
git commit -m "Created TopLevelDestination enum"             # 1 file
git commit -m "Added navigation helper functions to features" # 3 files
git commit -m "Created ChangingRoomAppState for navigation"       # 1 file
git commit -m "Created ChangingRoomApp with bottom navigation"    # 1 file
git commit -m "Updated MainActivity to use ChangingRoomApp"       # 1 file
```

### 6. Details Belong Elsewhere

- Code comments explain **how** and **why**
- Commit messages explain **what** changed
- Don't repeat what's obvious from the diff
- Commits should NOT have Body/Details

### 7. Separate Documentation Commits

- Documentation changes should be in separate commits
- Don't mix code changes with documentation updates

## Examples

### Good Commits ✓

```
Added UTC timezone handling strategy
Fixed memory leak in database connection
Removed unused dependencies
Updated navigation to Navigation Compose
Renamed ViewModel to ScreenModel
Added centralized build configuration
Fixed deprecated Compose APIs
Created core:domain module
Implemented schedule repository with Outcome
Configured Hilt dependency injection
Updated Kotlin to 2.1.0
Refactored repository to use Outcome instead of DataResult
```

### Bad Commits ✗

```
feat(build-logic): add comprehensive utilities documentation
WIP
WIP - still working
Updated files
Fixed stuff
Changes
Added feature X, fixed bug Y, updated docs, refactored Z
```

## Commit Templates by Type

### Feature Addition

```
Added <feature>
Implemented <functionality>
Created <module>
```

### Bug Fix

```
Fixed <issue>
Resolved <problem>
```

### Removal

```
Removed <item>
Deleted <unused code>
```

### Update/Modification

```
Updated <component>
Modified <behavior>
Refactored <code>
```

### Rename

```
Renamed <old> to <new>
```

### Configuration

```
Configured <setting>
Upgraded <dependency> to <version>
```

## Setup Commit Template (Optional)

Save this as `.gitmessage` in project root:

```bash
# <Subject: past tense, concise, no period>

# Why? (optional, only if not obvious)


# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Rules: past tense, concise, no period, <50 chars
# Details belong in code comments, not commits
```

Configure git to use it:

```bash
git config commit.template .gitmessage
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ WIP commits

```
WIP
WIP - still working
Almost done
```

### ❌ Generic messages

```
Updated files
Fixed stuff
Changes
```

### ❌ Commit novel syndrome

```
feat(core): comprehensive refactoring of entire data layer

This commit introduces a complete overhaul of...
[50 more lines]
```

### ❌ Mixed concerns

```
Added feature X, fixed bug Y, updated docs, refactored Z
```

## Remember

> **Atomic commits = one logical change**
>
> If explaining needs paragraphs = commit too big
>
> Documentation changes should be separate, not mixed with code
>
> **Each documentation file gets its own commit**

## Commit Workflow

** 🛑 START HERE when user says "commit":**

0. **🛑 GO TO "STOP AND VERIFY" SECTION AT TOP OF THIS FILE**
1. **Run all checks - FIX violations FIRST**
2. **Make atomic changes** - One logical change at a time
3. **Stage related files** - `git add` only files for this change
4. **Write clear message** - Follow the rules above
5. **Review before commit** - `git diff --staged`
6. **Commit** - `git commit`
7. **Verify** - Check the commit with `git show HEAD`

**If you skip step 0-1, you WILL create bad commits.**

## Helpful Git Aliases

To make it easier to follow these rules, run the setup script:

```bash
./scripts/setup-git-aliases.sh
```

This configures helpful aliases:

- `git push-safe` - Standard push (same as `git push`)
- `git check-push` - Run pre-push checks without pushing
- `git fix-commits` - Interactive rebase to fix commit violations
- `git push-emergency` - Emergency bypass (requires typing "YES" to confirm)

**Recommendation:** Use `git check-push` before pushing to catch issues early.
